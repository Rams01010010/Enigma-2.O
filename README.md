# Enigma-2.O
Own updated version of Enigma with no major flaws and with extra combinations and more !!!

## Enigma Settings
   #### Rotors : 
   - There are totally 10 rotors(I/II/III/IV/V/...) in this version and you should choose 5 rotors in correct order(Left to Right).
    
   #### Reflector:
   - There are 4 reflectors(A/B/C/D) in this version and you should choose one.
    
   #### Ring Setting : 
   - You can choose at what ring position of the ring the rotors should aligned (if 'C d @ 1 K' then 'C' of ring-1 will be aligned with 'A' of rotor-1 and so on).
    
   #### Plugboard :
   - You can use pair of letters seperated by `-S-` to indicate plugboard (if AB then 'A' will be mapped to 'B' & viceversa).
    
   #### Initial Position:
   - This is the starting position of the rotor after setting the machine.

## Finally !
 Enter the settings you need and you're done and you can 'start' and encrypt your messages :)
